# RezTailor Front-End

# Overview
RezTailor is a great way to create customizable documents. It is designed for resumes but can easily be adapted for grocery lists, thank you letters, etc.

With RezTailor, you can create multiple versions of a document. Each version has access to all of the sections from the master document, so you can easily add or remove sections as needed to tailor the document to the current purpose.

# User Stories:
